<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3159" delta="new" >The DCM, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">variable_freq_clk_generator_inst/DCM_CLKGEN_1</arg>, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
