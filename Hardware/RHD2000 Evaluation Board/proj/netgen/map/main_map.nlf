   "main" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6slx45, package fgg484, speed -2
Loading constraints from 'main.pcf'...
The speed grade (-2) differs from the speed grade specified in the .ncd file
(-2).
WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, variable_freq_clk_generator_inst/DCM_CLKGEN_1,
   has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase
   relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of
   this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using
   FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:Timing:3175 - hi_in<0> does not clock data to hi_out<1>
WARNING:Timing:3225 - Timing constraint COMP "hi_out<1>" OFFSET = OUT 11.93 ns
   AFTER COMP "hi_in<0>" "RISING"; ignored during timing analysis
WARNING:Anno:67 - NCD is not completely routed, some delays may be inaccurate.
The number of routable networks is 11400

INFO:NetListWriters:633 - The generated Verilog netlist contains Xilinx SIMPRIM simulation primitives and has to be used with SIMPRIM
   simulation library for correct compilation and simulation. 
INFO:NetListWriters - Xilinx recommends running separate simulations to check for setup by specifying the MAX field in the SDF file and for
   hold by specifying the MIN field in the SDF file. Please refer to Simulator documentation for more details on specifying MIN and MAX
   field in the SDF.
INFO:NetListWriters:665 - For more information on how to pass the SDF switches to the simulator, see your Simulator tool documentation.
